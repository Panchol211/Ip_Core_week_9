K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR AND NAIVE BAYERS MODELS 

Problem Statement: Implementation of K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier to see which model performs better and under which conditions  

Understanding the Business Context: 
Working on a titanic dataset and a spambase dataset.  
From titanic dataset we want to predict the survival rate of the people who where involved in that Titanic accident  
For the spambase dataset, we want to predict who will can the message be classifer as a spam or a genuine message  

Defining metrices of success:
I would developed a model that can attain an accuracy of over 80% and challenge my findings to see how best i could have improved my model for a better prediction. 

Expreimental Design:
Titanic Data set and SpamBase dataset be used  Perform exploratory on the data and feature enginering  Build the model and compare their performance  Loading libraries to be used to analysis these datasets
